Description: Check that LineBreakMeasurer.nextLayout does not throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
Author: Martin Frodl <mfrodl@redhat.com>

This is a test for BZ#112806. With some fonts (like STIX General), there have
been problems with so-called canonical processing, the process of blending
multiple characters together (in particular, this applies to combining marks
like various accents). Fonts can have a flag set to opt out of the canonical
processing, which was not respected by OpenJDK 6, leading to an exception
(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) being thrown if such an attempt was made. The
test checks if this does not happen any longer.
